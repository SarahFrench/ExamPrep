# Access and secure data

Static data = hard coded
Dynamic data = can change in response to user

Allowing data from users to enter the system introduces a new attack surface.
You need to validate data on the client side to help ensure stuff is entered correctly, but you also need to limit and possibility of users sending malicious data through.

## Objectives
- 3.1: validate user input using HTML5
- 3.2: validate user input using JavaScript
- 3.3: Consume data
- 3.4: Serialise, deserialise and transmit data
