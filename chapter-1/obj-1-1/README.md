## Obj:

HTML5, SEO, accessibility, layouts

Semanic HTML is useful for: SEO, accessibility, clarity when developing

Semantic HTML provides more context and clues for when the HTML is interpreted and indexed by a search engine. Using article and section tags signals to the SE that the main content of the page is in that tag, or that there are multiple blocks of info on the given page. Header information can get grouped with blocks of content, etc.

Semantic HTML also helps screen readers immensely as the software can create a document outline, which allows users to jump to particular sections, e.g. the <article> for content, or the <nav> to navigate away.


## Misc: 

### slash at the end of <meta charset="utf-8"/>
